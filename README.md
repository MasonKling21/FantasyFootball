A simple fantasy football companion app.

Everyone who has played fantasy football or other fantasy sports has drafted the biggest bust of all time, or has missed out on a great player. This web app hopes to minimize these picks and allows users to keep track of the rookies who have potential, underrated players, or the stars who are overrated. 

A few features include:
  A customizable do not draft list
  A customizable high priority draft list
  User registration and login functionality
  Ability to sort players by stats, name, team, etc
  
This is just a personal project to hopefully improve my fantasy football drafts in the future.
